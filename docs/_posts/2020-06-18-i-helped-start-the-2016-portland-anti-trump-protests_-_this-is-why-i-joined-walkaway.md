In this broadcast, I tell you the story about how I started the 2016 PDX Anti-Trump Protests because I was brainwashed by the MSM, and how I left the radical left and became a Republican and started Real Simple News with Cale McCollough. I also explain exactly how Facebook, Twitter, and MSM have been brainwashing us by targeting White feminist because women control 85% of consumer spending they are now holding 2/3 of the new college degrees, and they own 2/3 the wealth in the US, and how the Chinese "Communist"/Nazi Party has gamed Facebook via CCP-controlled company advertizements and they have gamed Wikipedia using foreign exchange students who are children of the CCP who have been editing Wikipedia in coordination with their Universities who have been receiving grants from the CCP to keep the Chinese foreign exchange students. I also break down the QAnon theory, what is credible, and what is not, and how it can be used by agents of a foreign power to blackmail US politicians by filming them having sex with underage prostitutes. I also tell you the truth about immigration, and how the Democrats are using shame tactics of anti-racism to shame Republicans into allowing Sanctuary states by using racial stereotypes of Latinos.

Correction: 49:00 I accidentally said 27% of Federal Drug trafficking charges were Latino, I meant to say 27% were Illegal Immigrants. The actual number is that 50% of Federal drug trafficking charges are from Latinos, and 30% are illegal immigrants, mostly from Mexico as of 2016. I'll record this video again at some point.
